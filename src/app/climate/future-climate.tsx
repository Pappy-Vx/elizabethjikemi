                            I want to help create a future where sustainability is no longer treated as a luxury, but embraced as the standard. A world where nonprofits do not have to choose between performance and purpose. A world where policy is driven not just by numbers, but by compassion and common sense.

                            In this future, climate strategy will be thoughtful and inclusive. It will welcome hard questions and honest answers. Who is affected? Who is included? Who is empowered to decide? These are the conversations we must have if we want to build something that lasts.
