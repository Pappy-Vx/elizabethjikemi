              2. Organizational Climate: Culture is a System
            </h3>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-4">
             Just as the weather influences how crops grow, the culture within an organization influences how people thrive. You cannot build anything meaningful in a toxic atmosphere, which is why I pay close attention to the undercurrentâ€”the quiet interactions, the pauses in meetings, and the way junior staff are treated when no one is watching.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-4">
             Culture is not defined by branded posters or mission statements. It lives in the daily experience. It shows up in whose ideas are valued, whose burnout is overlooked, and who feels safe enough to speak honestly.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-6">
             When I support organizations through cultural change, I begin by listening, deeply and without assumptions. Not through formal surveys, but through real conversations. I ask what people need in order to feel seen and supported. I make room for their frustrations, their hopes, and their desire for change.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-6">
             As trust begins to take root, I work with them to create new rhythms that actually work. Feedback that is clear and constructive. Mentorship that crosses titles and levels. Structures that prioritize equity over performance theatre. Because culture is not something you announce. It is something you practice, every single day.
