                The Climate Around Us: Systems, Stewardship and Sustainability
              </h3>

              <p className="text-md md:text-xl font-sourceSerif mb-6">
                For me, climate is not just about rising temperatures or melting ice. It is also about the mood of our world, the atmosphere in our boardrooms, and the condition of our shared home. It appears in the systems we build, the policies we support, and the everyday choices we make about how we care for people and places.
              </p>

              <p className="text-md md:text-xl font-sourceSerif mb-6">
                In my line of work, climate is not always the main focus, but it is always present. Every decision carries weight, and every system leaves a trace. The real question is not whether we are making an impact, but what kind of impact we are making. Are we building toward healing and restoration, or are we reinforcing patterns that no longer serve us?
              </p>

              <p className="text-md md:text-xl font-sourceSerif mb-6">
                As a child, I learned stewardship in quiet and practical ways. We turned off lights, reused containers, and respected what we had. It was not called sustainability then. It was simply common sense. Looking back, I see that those daily habits were early lessons in responsibility, not because it was trendy, but because it was necessary.
              </p>

              <p className="text-md md:text-xl font-roadRadio mb-6">
                Today, I believe those of us working in strategy, research and technology have a responsibility to keep the bigger picture in mind. Not as a checklist to complete, but as a core principle to live by. We are not just designing tools. We are helping shape the future.
