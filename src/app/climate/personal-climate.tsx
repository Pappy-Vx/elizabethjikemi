              4. Personal Climate: Values, Rhythm and Resilience

             Protecting my inner climate is part of how I stay grounded in the work. If I am not clear within myself, I cannot lead well. Just like system design, inner clarity requires intention, reflection, and care.

            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-4">
             My daily rhythms are simple. I seek morning light before screens. I take walks without an agenda. I journal in short, honest bursts when the words are heavy. These small practices help me stay present, especially when the world gets noisy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-6">
             There are a few mindsets I hold close. I choose curiosity instead of control. I choose grace instead of grind. These internal habits are what help me navigate intense seasons without losing myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="text-md md:text-lg font-sourceSerif mb-6">
             To me, resilience is the ability to adapt while holding on to your essence. It is not just about making it through. It is about growing deeper in the process. I return to this idea often. We do not need perfect conditions to show up with strength. We only need to stay rooted in what truly matters.
