              Lagos was my first classroom for strategy. If you can move through a Lagos market without being overcharged, squeezed by a danfo, or thrown off by a sudden fuel scarcity, then you can handle almost any boardroom. Nigerian life teaches strategy through motion. We donâ€™t wait for perfect conditions. We act. We build. We adjust.

              My parents modeled reinvention long before it became trendy. Whether it was finding a way to fix a cracked pot or figuring out how to seat nine people when there were only six chairs, I learned logistics before I had a name for it. Our communities formed food cooperatives before food banks were common, and thrift circles before digital lending apps. Nigeria has always been a place where creativity and resilience show up as everyday solutions.

              That foundation gives me an advantage in my work with nonprofits. I understand complexity. I know how to stay ready for shifts. I work with what's already in the room and see possibility where others may see limitation.
