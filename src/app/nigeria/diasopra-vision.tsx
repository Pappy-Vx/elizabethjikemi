              Holding space as both a Nigerian and a global professional means I speak two emotional languages. One language flows from ancestral wisdom and relationship. The other runs on calendars, KPIs, and delivery cycles. I have learned how to bring both into the same room. My education in Nigeria — first in International Relations and History, then in International Affairs and Public Administration — taught me how to carry multiple truths without dropping any of them. That training prepared me to lead across continents with clarity and cultural intelligence.

              When I show up globally as a Nigerian, I do so fully. I am not an exception. I am an example. My grandfather helped establish the first teaching hospital in our state. Today, I work to build healing structures too, through research, systems, and data. Our work looks different, but our mission is deeply connected.

              I stay rooted in Nigeria through board service, mentorship, and co-creating systems that meet local needs. Nigeria continues to call, and I continue to answer.
